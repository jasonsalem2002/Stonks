Advanced Technical Indicators:

RSI (Relative Strength Index): Measures the speed and change of price movements.
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.
Bollinger Bands: Provides a relative definition of high and low prices.
Implementation Example:

# Calculate RSI
def calculate_rsi(hist, window=14):
    delta = hist['Close'].diff()
    up = delta.clip(lower=0)
    down = -1 * delta.clip(upper=0)
    ema_up = up.ewm(com=window-1, adjust=False).mean()
    ema_down = down.ewm(com=window-1, adjust=False).mean()
    rs = ema_up / ema_down
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

# Inside get_stock_info function after calculating moving averages
hist['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(hist)
Interactive Dashboards:

Consider using libraries like Plotly or Dash to create interactive web dashboards for real-time data visualization.
Database Integration:

Store historical data and analysis results in a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for easier data management and retrieval.


User Interface:

Develop a simple GUI using Tkinter or PyQt to make the tool more user-friendly.
Performance Optimization:
